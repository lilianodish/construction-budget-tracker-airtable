# Construction Budget Tracker – Airtable Automation

This Airtable solution was built for a construction company overwhelmed by manual tracking. Field managers were spending hours updating budgets, subcontractor payments, and client reports—after already working full days on-site.

## 🚧 Problem
- Manual tracking of check payments per site
- No real-time overview of job progress or budget health
- Repetitive work after hours to update spreadsheets and send updates

## 💡 Solution
I designed an Airtable system that automated the entire financial tracking workflow:
- Uploading a check (in or out) automatically updated the project budget
- Real-time dashboard showed budget usage, subcontractor payouts, and status
- Shared client view gave instant access to project progress

## 🔁 Impact
- Saved ~10+ hours/week per field manager
- Reduced tracking errors and missed payments
- Gave the company a competitive edge with more professional reporting
- Let managers focus on supervising builds instead of back-office tasks

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Airtable (Formulas, Automations, Linked Views)
- Optional: Zapier or Make (for advanced uploads or integrations)
